                    <p>The C.D.C. begins testing people for previous coronavirus infections. Even after President
                        Trump’s
                        travel restrictions, about 40,000 people have flown to the U.S. from China. More than 3,500

                        have died in New York State.

                        The idea of going out on a date with your partner might seem insignificant compared with the
                        global pandemic at hand. But Dr. Racine Henry, a marriage and family therapist who operates both
